## Description
This is a previous project I started for a Marketing client for a BBA capstone class.  I found it necessary to parse advertising on social media for RGB values, average them out for each promotional piece, then compile these averages by advertiser to reveal trends in color preference for the client's industry.  This was began as a tool to do that.

## Tools included
+ RGBA image analyzer, value averager, and distribution visualizer
